This template is meant to be used for an individual microservice, so it could be used multiple times in the same project for different microservices each time.

---

### To use this template clone it with cookiecutter:

1. Install the `cookiecutter` library if it isn't already installed:
```pip3 install cookiecutter```

2. Use this cookiecutter template: ```cookiecutter gh:andrewguest/cookiecutter-fastapi-mongodb-microservice```

3. Answer the questions when prompted (example below):
    * ```microservice_name []:```
        * Cart Microservice
    * ```microservice_slug [cart-microservice]:```
        * This will be automatically generated by lowercasing your project name and replacing any space with a hyphen. You can just press enter here to use the default microservice_slug.
    * ```mongodb_local_storage:```
      * What path, on the host machine, do you want to mount into the MongoDB container for it to (persistantly) store data?
    * ```api_port []: 5050```
      * What port would you like the API container to listen on?

4. Start this service (these two containers): ```docker-compose up -d --build```

5. Test the API by going to: ```http://localhost:5050/ping```
(or whatever 'api_port' you supplied earlier)

6. Run tests (outside of Docker):
    1. Create a virtual environment: ```python3 -m venv my_venv```
    2. Activate virtual environment: ```source my_venv/bin/activate```
    3. Install requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    4. Run tests: ```pytest --verbose```

### What this template will do for you:

1. Create the folder structure for this microservice:
```
|-- app
  \-- {{ cookiecutter.microservice_slug }}_api.py (entry point for application)
|-- database (contains all database related code)
|-- routes (contains all routes to be defined)
|-- tests (contains all of the tests)
Dockerfile (build a Docker image based on the API code)
docker-compose.yml (start a container for the API and the MongoDB for this microservice)
```

2. Configure a Dockerfile needed to create an image based on this microservice.

3. Configure the docker-compose.yml file to start the API container and a MongoDB container.

4. Automatically setup the connection between the API and the MongoDB container, inside of ```app/{{ cookiecutter.microservice_slug }}_api.py```
